I am graduating soon and cannot help myself looking back with nostalgia and a little bit of sadness.

It took a village and I will show my gratitude to each one of them, but around this time, 3 years ago I lost someone, without whom I would not be here today. Thank you, Mr. Bennett.

I walk into my very first class, the first semester, university early morning under the bright sun\
I see this tall Santa last resembling man smiling, in his eyes he had a twinkle of fun\
He has this zest in life as he excitedly said "Welcome"\
I sat for the next three hours, listening simply dumb

In this very first encounter, I already knew\
Learning from you is a privilege, and teachers like you are very few\
Step by step you taught us how to explore capture the essence of literally everything\
You simply challenged me to best at almost anything

Anyone who ever talked to you felt like they had the power to achieve\
I write with tears in a weak attempt to grieve

Never again will I see the quirky texts on your t-shirts\
Your voice resonating through the walls so loud\
We dedicate our first short film to you, and only hope in the future\
The many more to come, make you beam with proud

I entered this country with doubts, fears, and the mood to survive\
You brought me out of my shell and taught me how to thrive\
You will always be remembered for your humor and compassion\
More time with you is the only thing with you I wish I had a chance to ration

I shall cling to every word of remark, wisdom, and encouragement you sent my way\
You'll always be the teacher who taught me how to write, think on set, storytelling and at the end of the day,\
You'll forever be in my memories in my work and never stop being keen\
From the wish book to the black hole, we never know when its a wrap on our scene
